Make new file

```
library(tidyverse)

16+1

df <- mtcars
```

Tried to knit: `cmd shft p`, "knit"
Got error: "Knitting requires the {rmarkdown} package

Install package `rmarkdown`
Go to R console/terminal
```
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

Tried knitting again
Error: "pandoc version 1.12.3 or higher is required and was not found"

Google error, found out pandoc isn't an R package but a unix app.  See if installed
```
pandoc --version
```
Output: command pandoc not found.
So not installed
Install via brew

```
brew install pandoc
```

Tried knitting again
